## Jeff's SQL Portfolio

### Welcome to my SQL portfolio! My name is Jeff and I am currently a 1st grade teacher. After over a decade of teaching in elementary schools, I decided to pursue a career using SQL as I believe my skillset is perfect for this craft. Outside of teaching and learning SQL, I'm an active founding-member of Learning for Equity Network, which analysizes equitable ways to teach mathematics using cuturally relevant pedagogy. I also spend my free time learning Italain (currently taking C1 classes) and playing soccer. 

This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written during my SQL bootcamp. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.
